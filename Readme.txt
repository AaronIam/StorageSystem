The storage system we are developing is designed to efficiently store objects along with their characteristics, 
enabling robust and precise search functionality. Key features of our system include the ability to catalog items 
based on various attributes such as color, weight, size, and images. Users can perform searches using any combination 
of these characteristics to quickly locate the desired item's position within the database. This innovative 
solution is being developed by two college students with a focus on creating a user-friendly and highly effective 
storage and retrieval system for diverse applications.
